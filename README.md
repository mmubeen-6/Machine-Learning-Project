# Physical activity classification using time-frequency signatures of motion artifacts

This is my machine learning project in which classification of 5 different physical activities was done. They are: 
* Coughing
* Reaching
* Walking
* Eating
* Rolling-on-bed

Different classifiers were used for training on features extracted from the data of 19 adult human subjects and then compared. The corresponding report is also attached. It is actually the implementation of a [paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8037474/?reload=true) by Hassan Aqeel Khan, Amit Gore and Jeff Ashe. The code is attached by in the appendix but you may first need to extract the .rar file in the same folder.
